					<p><br>Gayla Margolin, Professor of Psychology and Pediatrics at the 
					University of Southern California, is a member of the Clinical Science Faculty. Dr. Margolinâ€™s primary interests are in 
					the resilience of young people, particularly as they transition to adolescence and then from adolescence to young 
					adulthood.  Her research focuses on the interplay between social, behavioral, and biological factors and the role of 
					family influences in development.  The results of research in her lab relate directly to the applied goals of minimizing 
					the effects of family violence and reducing the rates of family violence.<br><br>
					
					Dr. Margolin received her Ph.D. from the University of Oregon and her B.A. from the University of Wisconsin. She has 
					over 100 publications that explore marital and family relations. A number of her publications focus on the ways that 
					conflict and violence derail the normal developmental processes of families and individual family members, particularly 
					children. She co-authored the book, Marital Therapy: Strategies Based on Social Learning and Behavior Exchange Principles
					and has also published on ethical issues in couple and family therapy and research. Support for her work comes from the 
					David and Lucile Packard Foundation and from NICHD and NIMH grants.<br><br>
					
					Dr. Margolin received a Harry Frank Guggenheim Career Development Award, the 1993 Award for Distinguished Contribution to
					Family Systems Research from the American Family Therapy Academy, and 2013 USC Raubenheimer Award. She has been on the 
					editorial board of 15 professional journals, including positions as Associate Editor for the Journal of Family Psychology
					and Behavioral Assessment.  Dr. Margolin received 2006 and 2008 USC Awards for Excellence in Mentoring. She is a 
					licensed psychologist in California. Her invited addresses include presentations to the California Assembly Select 
					Committee on Domestic Violence and the Domestic Violence Training Program of the Los Angeles Superior Court.</p>
