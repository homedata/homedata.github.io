					<p><br><br><br>Adela graduated from the University of Kansas with a BA in Psychology and a minor in Social and Behavioral Sciences 
					Research Methodology. She is currently pursuing a combined PhD in Clinical and Quantitative Psychology. She is interested in 
					close relationships and in particular couple dynamics. She uses ecological momentary assessment and ambulatory physiological 
					measurement to examine family and couple functioning in daily life. She is also interested in how early family relationships 
					affect stress responding and physiological set points later in life. She received a National Science Foundation Graduate 
					Research Fellowship to study physiological coregulation in romantic couples in the home environment and to examine how early 
					family environments impact physiological coregulation in romantic relationships in adulthood. Quantitatively, she is 
					interested in intensive longitudinal data analysis for couples and families.</p>
