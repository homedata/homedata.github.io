<h2>The Home Data and Mobile Sensing Project</h2>

<b>The Home Data and Mobile Sensing Project</b> is an interdisciplinary collaboration conducted by psychologists and electrical engineers at the University of Southern California. Our goal is to develop and implement mobile technology for collecting data in daily life. For information about funding, click here.

<b>Couples and Families in Daily Life:</b> Is the mundane significant? We seek to understand how subtle processes are associated with important outcomes. Small, daily behaviors can have large impacts on functioning and are important points of intervention for improving individual and couple functioning.

<b>Ambulatory Physiological Monitoring and Mobile Technology:</b> We are testing and implementing mobile physiological monitors to collect electrodermal activity, skin temperature, heart rate, and movement. We have also developed a smartphone application that collects self-report, audio, and GPS data.

<b>Cross-Disciplinary Advances in Science:</b> Our work spans multiple disciplines, including psychology, electrical engineering, computer science, and statistics. We apply novel methodologies and statistical techniques to emerging technologies to advance psychological theory and intervention.

<b>Sharing of Scientific Findings and Resources:</b> As part of our research effort, we disseminate our results with the public and other scientists. We also share software, code, and statistical knowledge with the goals of spreading knowledge and increasing the accessibility and feasibility of these methods.
