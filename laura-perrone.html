					<p style="margin-left: -285px; margin-right: -80px"><br><br><br><br>Laura works as a lab manager at the USC Family Studies Project, where 
					she coordinates the home data portion of the lab’s current study examining dating relationships. She is involved in 
					recruitment and scheduling of participants, running visits with couples, and working with the home data team as they 
					process and analyze data from this project. Laura graduated from Pomona College in 2014 with a BA in Psychology. Her 
					previous research experience included studying attachment theory with Dr. Yael Shmueli-Goetz and working as a research 
					assistant for Dr. Jessica Borelli in the Pomona College Child Attachment, Relationships, and Emotion (CARE) Lab. Her 
					senior thesis explored the relation between spontaneous attributions for failure and children’s mental health outcomes.  
					Laura is interested in further exploring the role that individual and relational factors play in contributing to mental 
					health and in applying the findings of empirical research to clinical interventions. Laura plans to pursue a Ph.D. in 
					Clinical Psychology.&nbsp;</p>
