					<p><br><br><br>My program of research investigates emotional and behavioral processes in romantic relationships and their 
					potentially dysregulating impact on the psychological health of individual partners and the overall functioning of their 
					relationship. Within this broader scope, my research focuses on three related aims: 1) identifying dysfunctional 
					processes during couple conflict, 2) studying interventions designed to reduce risk for engaging in dysfunctional 
					processes, and 3) developing new analytic methods for assessing and characterizing couple interaction processes.  Our 
					collaborative work on these aims uses a combination of standard observational coding methods for measuring enacted 
					behavior as well as applied signal methods. This interdisciplinary approach has allowed us to come up with solutions to 
					long unsolved problems by examining them in new ways. For example, we recently proposed a new theoretical model of the 
					emotional underpinnings of the demand/withdraw interaction pattern (a maladaptive pattern of behavior associated with 
					increased risk for depression, intimate partner violence, infidelity, and divorce) that resolves multiple failed tests 
					of the previous model of emotional arousal and demand/withdraw behavior that had stood for almost 30 years. Likewise, 
					identification of pre-treatment variables that are consistently associated with treatment outcomes in couple therapy and 
					pre-treatment variables that are associated with differential response to behaviorally based couple therapies have been 
					incredibly rare. Our work on vocally encoded emotional arousal shows that it is not only a predictor of treatment 
					outcomes in clinical trials in both the United States and Germany but also that different combinations of pre-treatment 
					relationship distress and vocally encoded emotional arousal are associated with differential response to treatment. 
					Finally, our most recent and on-going work uses signal processing facilitated methods to study the intersection of 
					behavior, emotion, psychophysiology, and relationship functioning during real life.<br><br>
