					<p><br><br><br><br>Sohyun's research aims to 1) investigate how child adversity leads to an 
				increased risk of interpersonal conflicts in adolescence and adulthood, and 2) to identify the protective factors that may 
				interrupt this vulnerability and lead to resilience. Toward that aim, she received a National Science Foundation Graduate 
				Research Fellowship in 2014 to understand the interplay among vocal, behavioral, and physiological indices of emotion during 
				emotionally-charged discussions between dating partners. In this project, she is particularly interested in exploring 
				whether vocal reactivity is a key mechanism by which child adversity sensitizes individuals to interpersonal conflicts in 
				adulthood. Additionally, she is interested in coding audio samples from dating partners at home to better understand 
				day-to-day markers of risk and resilience within dating relationships.</p>
